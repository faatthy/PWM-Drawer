# PWM-Drawer
Determination of the width of the pulse created by the microcontroller's timer using input catpure and data is being displayed via LCD.   


# System Description
• Description – PWM drawer:   
❑ PWM drawer works as a mini oscilloscope that is responsible 
for printing the frequency and the waveform of the generated 
PWM signal.   
❑ The generated wave came from two sources, external sources 
(e.g. generated PWM from other MCs), or internal source of 
the Microcontroller of the project itself.     
# • Specification – Graphical LCD:
❑ With the graphical LCD we can display the following:  
• The shape of the generated PWM from internally or 
externally sources.   
• The frequency in KHz of the generated wave on the upper 
left side of the LCD.   
• The duty cycle of the generated wave on the upper right 
side of the LCD.   
• The time of the single cycle .
